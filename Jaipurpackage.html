        <p>The third angle of India’s coveted Golden Triangle along with Delhi and Agra, Jaipur is vibrant in its display of traditional Rajasthani culture. Jaipur tour packages entail a trip into its heart, to the old walled quarter called the Pink City whose labyrinthine bazaars heave with traditional Rajasthani handicraft ranging from jewellery, clothes, pottery to woodwork. Rated among the most exclusive in Asia, this bazaar alone draws people to Jaipur who do not seem to mind the crowds, the ambitious salesmen and the dizzying energy of it all. Among the most flamboyant states in the country, Jaipur’s streets despite its trundling buses, ambling camels, buzzing auto-rickshaws and swarms of motorcycles, offer visual splendors in the form of its architectural masterpieces and oasis of calm that you would feel you are in someplace exotic. 
        </p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Jaipur can be divided into three main areas. The urban sprawl at its heart which is the Pink City, home to the Hawa Mahal and City Palace. The south of the Pink City is greener and calmer, the commotion that comes with the old walled city missing here; this part is home to the Central Museum, Ram Niwas Garden. The third part is the outskirt which is dotted with several royal vestiges such as the Nahargarh Fort, the temples of Galta and the royal cenotaphs at Royal Gaitor.

                <br><br><h3><B>How to reach Jaipur</B></h3>
                <br>
                Jaipur is well-connected by means of air, rail and road transport. The Jaipur International Airport being less than 10 kilometre from the city centre, all major trains plying to Jaipur from different parts of the country, and great highways leading one to Jaipur by means of car or bus.
                <br><br>
                <h3><b>Things to do in Jaipur </b></h3>
                <br>
                <h3>Beyond the Pink City</h3>

                To the south of the Pink City is a broad road going out from New Gate and is flanked by the greenery-studded Ram Niwas Gardens, named after the person who built it, Maharaja Ram Singh between (1835 to 1880). Amid the garden looms the stunning Albert Hall and to its south the Museum of Indology. To the north of the Pink City stretches the Nahargarh Fort while to its east over an elevation is the very popular Monkey Palace or Galta.
<br>
<h3>Nahargarh Fort: </h3>
On the edge of the hills to the north of Jaipur is the dramatic Nahargarh Fort, meaning the abode of tigers that harks back on the belief that tigers roamed freely on the hills. This magnificent fort on the Aravalli ranges in Jaipur was constructed by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II in 1734 as a defence for Jaipur city.
 

<br> 
<h3>Amber Fort:</h3>
The star-attraction of Jaipur, this grandiose fort is made up of elaborate and exquisite palace complex built from pink and pale yellow sandstone and even white marble. The complex is divided into four sections, each having its own courtyard. You can visit the fort on the back of an elephant like the kings of yore, or simply walk up to the fort in around 10 minutes. You also have the choice of taking 4WD to the top and back.
<br>
<h3>Albert Hall:</h3>
One of Jaipur’s most prominent landmarks, the Albert Hall built in 1867 is an interesting melange of Mughal and Venetians styles. The structure is home to the Central Museum which houses a collection that focuses on traditional as well as other Indian themes. You will find some of the finest displays of Jaipur pottery, a range of Mughal as well as Rajasthani miniature paintings, jewellery collection, clay figurines, woodwork and furniture, numismatics, musical instruments, ivory work, carpets, statues of Hindu gods and goddesses aside from artifacts from all around the world such as Egyptian antiques, hand-painted tiles outside of priceless articles from Myanmar, Japan and Persia.
<h3>Royal Gaitor:</h3> 
To the north of the city centre is the Royal Gaitor, a walled funeral complex home to stately marble cenotaphs or chhatris of the royal family of Jaipur. There are two main courtyards in the complex and each are crammed with elaborate marble mausoleums. The first courtyard comprises the magnificent 20th century cenotaph of Madho Singh II, a lover of food and one who fathered 125 children with his four wives and some 50-odd concubines. The more elaborate cenotaph belongs to Jai Singh II who died in 1743, he had founded Jaipur and is also the first ruler to be interred at this Royal Gaitor. On top of the ridge over the Gaitor which you can reach through a steep flight of stairs is the Ganesh Mandir, one of the major Ganesh temples in the city.
